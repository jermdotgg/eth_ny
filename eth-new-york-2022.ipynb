If this is the case, you will use whatever mechanism allows you to speculate on that belief specifically and get rewarded for it in the most efficient way to do so. Being an AMM LP is not that, because LP's make money off of exchange/trading volume, not through speculation of the LPs themselves.

But, since the price oracle itself is the AMM prediction market, this is what we want! We need slippage because we need price discovery. If someone wants to be a speculator and LP, all they have to do is buy/sell, which provides the liquidity. We can think of the initial LP initialization to be our gauge of price impact to prediction, if we places a trillion in the pool, it would take a lot of money to reflect someone's true probability, if we placed only 10 in the pool, we can only get to a certain level of granularity.

So, anyone who has this liquidity and wants to provide it and has a belief, they would just make the exchange.

If the profit making minimum in $$ terms is high (people not willing to trade unless they make $1,000 given nobody else is willing to take the other side).
