Because, impermanent loss comes from losing the apprecaiting asset in exchange for the depreciating ones.

If this is the case, you will use whatever mechanism allows you to speculate on that belief specifically and get rewarded for it in the most efficient way to do so. Being an AMM LP is not that, because LP's make money off of exchange/trading volume, not through speculation of the LPs themselves. Zoom out to traditional DEXes like UniSwap and Balancer, If I thought eth would crash, I would not go to a pool with eth in it and then be an LP for it, I would short eth. \n",

    "If a token becomes illiquid on our AMM, then anybody who believes that team may not win can mint all tokens, sell back that illiquid token to the exchange, and gain an amount of all other tokens. So $1 -> 1.X amount of all other tokens, besides the illiquid one. A token will only stay depleted and illiquid if they are the clear winners. But, since the price oracle itself is the AMM prediction market, this is what we want! We need slippage because we need price discovery."
